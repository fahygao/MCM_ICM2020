# MCM_ICM2020


This is the final version of our submission for the problem D in The Mathematical Contest in Modeling in 2020. 

Objective for this paper is to explore the complex interactions among the football players on the field that can influence the team’s success overall. Besides this, we want to determine the team dynamics and individual players’qualities and how these factors influence the team’s performance throughout the season. Finally, we want to present a specific team strategy to improve team performance for the next season.
